## Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) & Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) Classifier:

The Iris Species dataset includes three types of iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. There are 4 features/attributes and three classes. A 5-fold cross-validation will be conducted to assess the classification performance of both Linear Discriminant Analysis and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis classifiers. The optimal classifier will be identified by considering the overall model performance and examining individual metrics such as Confusion Matrix, sensitivity, specificity, total accuracy, F1-score, and ROC & AUC curve for each classifier.
